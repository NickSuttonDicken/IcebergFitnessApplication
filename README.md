# IcebergFitnessApplication  (WIP)
An Android (Future IOS Port Planned) Mobile Application written in Kotlin. It allows users to make, edit, and track workout plans in a simple but innovative way. It is designed using Material Design 2 components and design principles. It will utilise a SQLite Database to edit and manage the user's workouts, details, and workout plans. It will also make use of a SpringBoot RESTful Web Service API (Hosted on a cloud service yet to be decided) and Google Authentication for login in purposes to allow data sync so users can use on multiple mobile devices.
